# 【Problem 3】The Longest Sequence of Decreasing Numbers

## Objectives

Write a Python program that receives a sequence of integers and determines the length of the longest consecutive stretch of numbers in descending order. The test data should be entered as a single line of numbers separated by a space.

## Requirements

The task requires the implementation of a Python program that takes a sequence of integers as input and computes the length of the longest continuous subsequence of numbers where all elements are in descending order. It is important to note that the program should output only the length of the longest subsequence and not the subsequence itself. The input data should be provided in a single line, with the numbers separated by spaces.

## Example Usage

```
prob03> python .\\main.py
1 2 3 4 5 4 3 6 7 8 9 7 4 2 1
5

prob03> python .\\main.py
9 8 7 6 1 2 3 4 5 4 4 3 2
5

prob03> python .\\main.py
9 8 7 8 5 4 4 3 2 5
3

```

## Self-testing locally
It's recommended that you self-test your solution before submitting it. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:

```
python testing.py
```

This script runs the automated tests to verify if your solution is correct or not.

Alternatively, you can run the following command if you have the "make" tool installed:

```
make
```
