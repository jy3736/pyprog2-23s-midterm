# 【Problem 1】Identify the Maximum and Minimum Values

## Objectives

The goal of this problem is to create a Python script that can take five integers as input from the user without any prompts, and use a couple of if statements to determine the largest and smallest numbers from the input.

## Requirements

The script should prompt the user to input five integers. The script should then use a couple of if statements to determine the largest and smallest numbers from the input. The largest and smallest numbers should be displayed on the same line, separated by a space.

## Example Usage

```
PS lab01> python .\\main.py
3
4
5
6
7
7 3

PS lab01> python .\\main.py
-4
3
-2
6
9
9 -4

```
