## Python Programming Midterm Exam Submission Instructions

This midterm exam will test your knowledge and skills in python programming. You will solve five problems that are in different folders. Each folder has test cases that you can use to check your code. Your code should run correctly and give the right answers. You can use your notes and the internet during the exam, but you cannot work with anyone or copy any solutions from other sources. You have three hours to finish the exam and upload your code as a zip file on Flipclass.

- To ensure a fair evaluation, please do not modify any files or directories outside the `src` directory. All of your code should be placed inside the `src` directory.

- For the most part, you'll just need to write your code in the `main.py` file located under each `src/lab` or `src/hw` directory. Unless you're certain of what you're doing, please avoid modifying any other files in these directories.

- To submit your assignment, please use the `submit` command. You can execute this command by typing `submit` in your terminal. 

- Please note that you can only submit your assignment up to `5 times`, so make sure to test your code thoroughly before submitting.

- If you're having trouble executing the `submit` command, try changing its mode by typing `chmod +x submit` in your terminal, and then try again.

### Good luck with your midterm exam!
